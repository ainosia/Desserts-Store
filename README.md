# Desserts Store

An e-commerce application from scratch which includes a homepage with a product storefront and a shopping cart.

For the product data, I have used json-server, which is a tool that allows to create a complete REST API from a JSON file.

## Angular version

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Backend server

To start backend server, run:

```bash
npm run backend
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
